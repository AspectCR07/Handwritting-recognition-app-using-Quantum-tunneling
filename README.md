ðŸ–‹ Quantum-Inspired Handwritten Text Recognition with TrOCR
This project implements a handwritten text recognition system using Microsoft's TrOCR model, enhanced with a custom quantum-inspired optimizer for potentially improved training dynamics.

It includes:

Training Script (trainQ.py) â€“ Trains a TrOCR model on handwritten text data stored in .parquet format.

Testing Script (testQ.py) â€“ Runs inference on a single handwritten image to extract text.

ðŸš€ Features
Cached Dataset Loading â€“ Preloads and processes images into memory for faster training.

Quantum-Inspired Optimizer â€“ A custom optimizer that simulates certain quantum behavior concepts for gradient updates.

Hugging Face Transformers Integration â€“ Leverages TrOCRProcessor and VisionEncoderDecoderModel.

Easy Model Saving/Loading â€“ Trained model and processor are stored for future inference.

ðŸ›  Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-trocr.git
cd quantum-trocr
Install dependencies:


pip install torch torchvision transformers pandas pillow tqdm
(Optional) Install GPU support for PyTorch:


pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
ðŸ“Š Training
Prepare your dataset in Parquet format:

Each row must have:

image (dict with bytes key for image data)

text (ground truth transcription)

Run the training script:


python trainQ.py
Default model: microsoft/trocr-base-stage1

Output directory: trocr_handwritten_quantum_inspired

ðŸ§ª Testing
Update the image_path and model_dir variables in testQ.py with:

The path to your test image

The directory where your model is saved

Run:


python testQ.py
Example output:

Predicted Text: hello world
ðŸ“¦ Model Saving and Loading
After training, the model and processor are saved to the specified directory:

arduino

trocr_handwritten_quantum_inspired/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ pytorch_model.bin
â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessor_config.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
These can be loaded in testing or in any Hugging Face compatible pipeline.

ðŸ§  Quantum-Inspired Optimizer
The QuantumInspiredOptimizer modifies gradient updates by simulating momentum with a dynamic scaling factor, inspired by certain quantum probability adjustments.

Update formula:

exp_avg = Î² * exp_avg + (1 - Î²) * grad
param   = param - lr * (1 + Î³ * step) * exp_avg
ðŸ“Œ Requirements
